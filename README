Language::Prolog::Yaswi
=======================

Language::Prolog::Yaswi provides a bidirectional interface between
Perl and SWI-Prolog (http://www.swi-prolog.org/)


INSTALLATION

To install this module the SWI-Prolog executable "pl" has to be in the
PATH or alternatively the PL environment variable can be used to
select another executable name and location.

Type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   # or 'PL=/path/to/my/swi-prolog/executable perl Makefile.PL'
   make
   make test
   make install

pl.pl script should be copied to a place in the PATH (pl.pl is a
wrapper to run Prolog with support for calling Perl).

Both or none Perl and SWI-Prolog have to be compiled with thread
support. Other configurations are not supported and the build
process will refuse to make the module with them.

Under Perl only the ithread model is supported.

If you get SEGV errors when using the module try compiling the
prolog library with --disable-segv-handling (and send me also a
bug report!).


BUGS

Requires SWI-Prolog 5.6.x or newer

Loading of prolog shared libraries doesn't work, this is due to a
limitation on SWI-Prolog itself.

The programing interface should not be considered stable,
incompatibilities could be introduced in future releases.


MS WINDOWS SUPPORT

This module has been minimal tested under windows, it seems to work,
and I plan to support it, but the primary development platform
continues to be Linux/Unix.

To make it work, the "bin" directory for your SWI-Prolog installation
will have to be included in your PATH also at runtime (If you get an
error telling about the lippl.dll being missing, try using 8 chars
names in the PATH, i.e. C:\PROGRA~1\SWI-PR~1\BIN).


DEPENDENCIES

This module requires SWI-Prolog already installed in your system and
these other modules and libraries:

	Language::Prolog::Types
	Language::Prolog::Sugar (recommended)
	Test::More (only for testing)
